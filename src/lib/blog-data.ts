This tiny proof is then submitted to the main Layer 1 blockchain (like Ethereum). Instead of verifying thousands of individual transactions, the main chain only needs to verify one small, computationally-efficient proof.

They rely on public randomness, making them more secure in theory. However, STARKs produce larger proof sizes, which makes them more expensive to verify on-chain.

Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs), also known as Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), are an elegant solution to this problem, creating a way to both secure the network and participate in DeFi simultaneously.' },

Written directly into Bitcoin\'s source code by its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, the halving occurs automatically every 210,000 blocks, which takes approximately four years to complete. This process will continue until the final bitcoin is mined around the year 2140, at which point the total supply will be capped at 21 million coins forever.' },

When they successfully solve a problem, they get to add the next "block" of transactions to the blockchain. As a reward for this computationally intensive work, they receive a certain amount of newly created bitcoin, known as the "block reward." The halving is the event that cuts this block reward in half. When Bitcoin was created in 2009, the reward was 50 BTC per block. The first halving in 2012 reduced it to 25 BTC, the second in 2016 to 12.5 BTC, the third in 2020 to 6.25 BTC, and the most recent in 2024 to 3.125 BTC.' },

According to the basic economic principles of supply and demand, if demand for an asset remains constant or increases while its supply issuance is sharply reduced, the price of that asset should, in theory, increase. Historically, the periods following each Bitcoin halving have been associated with significant bull markets.

This creates a long-term fee market that is designed to sustain the network\'s security budget even after the last bitcoin has been mined. The halving is, therefore, not just a price catalyst but a crucial part of the elegant economic and game-theoretic design that has allowed Bitcoin to operate securely and autonomously for over a decade.' },
